                        <p>This book involves mostly healthy recipes, but there are some treats too. It should help you lose some weight or at least start eating a little bit healthier. I will try to convince you, that you can enjoy food and still loose weight.</p>

                    <div id="intro2">
                        <p>I will try to update the recipes as often as possible and should be easy to make. I will also be trying not to put fancy ingredients in the recipes and hopefully you will already have msot of the ingredients at home, but there will also be some for special occasions when you have some very specific ingredient, and don't know what to do with it.</p>
